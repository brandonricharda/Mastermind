# Mastermind

This exercise is part of The Odin Project. The goal is to create a game of mastermind that is played on the command line.

To run the game, download all files in a folder. From the directory, run $ ruby control.rb. You will be presented with the choice of guessing the computer's code or having the computer guess yours.
